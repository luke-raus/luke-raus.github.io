## Hi! I'm Luke.

I'm an engineer passionate about leveraging robotics & controls to make the world a better place for us all.

Some of my recent work includes:

- Optimizing building energy use via Reinforcement Learning (RL) in campus HVAC systems
- Designing and benchmarking novel Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithms for safety-critical systems
- Collaborating with Semtech on developing a distributed IoT solution to preventing damage from freezing in plumbing systems

I graduated with a B.S. in Engineering with a concentration in Robotics from [Olin College of Engineering](https://www.olin.edu/) in 2024. You can check out some of my work on my [Github](https://github.com/luke-raus).
